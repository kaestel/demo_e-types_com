			<h1>Competences</h1>

			<h2 class="main">
				It’s all in the mix. We put <br />together very diverse people <br />with very diverse professions. <br />
				We live in the unexpected.
			</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Strategy</h3>
					<p>
						Strong brands are built on simple, meaningful, and attractive big ideas. Made from 
						strategic thinking combined with creative development. So we talk to people, map challenges, 
						explore opportunities, and create direction. Our approach is qualitative and user-centred, 
						and guided by our strong instinct for what is right.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>
						Great design inspire people to take action. The core of our award winning design is conceptual strength 
						and genuine craftsmanship. We push the boundaries for what design can do and 
						stretch it into fashion, lifestyle and architecture. Expect to be challenged.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Digital</h3>
					<p>
						We craft rich digital experiences – cutting edge solutions rooted in strategy and design. 
						We ensure user value by curating content and sales through strong brand communication. 
						Merging digital innovation and business objectives, we prepare brands for tomorrow.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Communication</h3>
					<p>
						We believe that communication at it’s best is attractive and involving. The brands that 
						move the world forward reach out because they touch both our hearts and minds. We create 
						bold communication, which is truly engaging – messages that you fall in love with.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="theway">
				<h2>The way we work</h2>

				<p>
					Everything we do is rooted in strategy. We don’t do quick fixes. All projects – from small 
					evolutions to grand revolutions – are made to explore and fulfill the potential of our clients' 
					businesses.
				</p>
				<p>
					We like maximum impact. So we work on all the platforms your customers meet, from online to 
					offline, from interior to exterior, from people to products. Telling one story in many ways.
				</p>
				<p>
