				<p>
					No brand is better than its implementation. e-Types Daily is a design agency specialized in 
					working with visual identities. We make sure the visual expression of our clients is maintained 
					and further developed in each product we design. Design is business. Why invest resources in 
					developing your brand and visual identity if you do not follow through? To ensure the ROI 
					the everyday solutions have to be at least as good as the concept. That is why we care about 
					every single task for our clients.
				</p>
				<p>
					The world is a hands-on place. We have a broad and deep experience and knowledge with the way 
					our clients organizations’ work and how to see through projects through to the finish line. 
					We respect constraints and we know the importance of being on time and being on budget. Design 
					makes all the difference. We love design for its power. Design can make complicated matters 
					simple. Design speaks to both sides of the brain. Design can make the mundane beautiful. Bringing 
					brands to life through visual communication is what matters to us.
